Relation columns MUST be in all caps.
Selection ONLY works with conditions of the form a=5 or a=asdf. Basically, operators are not implemented.
	In addition, if strings are stored in the file with quotes around them (like in biz), then you need to put quotes around the string in the selection as well.
	For example, SELECT name FROM biz WHERE state=tx; will NOT work. SELECT name FROM biz WHERE state='tx'; will work.
	
When projecting multiple columns, there must not be any spaces between the column names.
	For example, SELECT a,b,c FROM tbl WHERE d=5; will work, but SELECT a, b, c FROM tbl WHERE d=5; will NOT work.
  
  Keeps track of #rows, #blocks, and #distinct values for indexed columns. Use the INFO; command to display these stats.
	Please note that #blocks is rounded down, so tables that do not take up at least 1 block on disk will show as having 0 blocks.
	You may have to run the REFRESH; command to see the results of insertions on the info.
  
  DISTINCT works, but only for single column projections. 
	ie. select distinct x from table where a=b; will work, but select distinct x,y from table where a=b; wil not.
